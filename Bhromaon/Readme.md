This site without JS. This is a responsive, adaptive and cross-browser
                        landing page created using CSS, semantic HTML, strictly according to the BEM
                        methodology and according to templates for different screen extensions (pixel perfect).
                        The icons were made in SVG sprite format. Standard validation was also added to the
                        form.
